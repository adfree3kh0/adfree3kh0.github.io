  <h2 id="1-information-do-we-collect">1. INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT</h2>
  <p><strong>Personal information:</strong> We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide and disclose to
    us when you express an interest in obtaining information about us or our products and Services, when you participate
    in activities on the Services, or otherwise when you contact us.</p>
  <p><strong>Sensitive Information:</strong> We do not process sensitive information. All personal information that you
    provide to us must be true, complete, and accurate, and you must notify us of any changes to such personal
    information.</p>
  <p><strong>Information automatically collected:</strong> We automatically collect certain information when you visit,
    use, or navigate the Services. This information does not reveal your specific identity (like your name or contact
    information) but may include device and usage information, such as your IP address, browser and device
    characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, device name, country, location, information
    about how and when you use our Services, and other technical information. This information is primarily needed to
    maintain the security and operation of our Services, and for our internal analytics and reporting purposes.</p>
  <p>Like many businesses, we also collect information through cookies and similar technologies.</p>
  <p>The information we collect includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong><em>Log and Usage Data</em></strong><em>.</em> Log and usage data is service-related, diagnostic, usage,
      and performance information our servers automatically collect when you access or use our Services and which we
      record in log files. Depending on how you interact with us, this log data may include your IP address, device
      information, browser type, and settings and information about your activity in the Services (such as the date/time
      stamps associated with your usage, pages and files viewed, searches, and other actions you take such as which
      features you use), device event information (such as system activity, error reports (sometimes called &quot;crash
      dumps&quot;), and hardware settings).</li>
    <li><strong><em>Device Data.</em></strong> We collect device data such as information about your computer, phone,
      tablet, or other device you use to access the Services. Depending on the device used, this device data may include
      information such as your IP address (or proxy server), device and application identification numbers, location,
      browser type, hardware model, Internet service provider and/or mobile carrier, operating system, and system
      configuration information.</li>
    <li><strong><em>Location Data.</em></strong> We collect location data such as information about your device&#39;s
      location, which can be either precise or imprecise. How much information we collect depends on the type and
      settings of the device you use to access the Services. For example, we may use GPS and other technologies to
      collect geolocation data that tells us your current location (based on your IP address). You can opt out of
      allowing us to collect this information either by refusing access to the information or by disabling your Location
      setting on your device. However, if you choose to opt out, you may not be able to use certain aspects of the
      Services.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="2-how-we-process-your-information">2. HOW WE PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION</h2>
  <p>We process your personal information for a variety of reasons, depending on how you interact with our Services,
    including to save or protect an individual&#39;s vital interest. We may process your information when necessary to
    save or protect an individual&#39;s vital interest, such as to prevent harm.</p>
  <h2 id="3-legal-bases-we-rely-on-to-process-your-information">3. LEGAL BASES WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION
  </h2>
  <p><strong>If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.</strong></p>
  <p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in
    order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your
    personal information:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Consent</strong>. We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e., consent) to use
      your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time. Email us to
      ADFREE3KH0.GITHUB.IO/CONTACT</li>
    <li><strong>Legal Obligations</strong>. We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for
      compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency,
      exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are
      involved.</li>
    <li><strong>Vital Interests</strong>. We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect
      your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to
      the safety of any person.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.</strong></p>
  <p>We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e., express consent) to use your
    personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e., implied
    consent). You can withdraw your consent at any time. Email us at <a
      href="&#x6d;&#97;&#x69;&#x6c;&#x74;&#x6f;&#58;&#65;&#x44;&#70;&#82;&#x45;&#x45;&#x33;&#75;&#72;&#48;&#64;&#x47;&#x4d;&#x41;&#x49;&#76;&#x2e;&#67;&#x4f;&#77;">&#65;&#x44;&#70;&#82;&#x45;&#x45;&#x33;&#75;&#72;&#48;&#64;&#x47;&#x4d;&#x41;&#x49;&#76;&#x2e;&#67;&#x4f;&#77;</a>
  </p>
  <p>In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without
    your consent, including, for example:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way</li>
    <li>For investigations and fraud detection and prevention</li>
    <li>For business transactions provided certain conditions are met</li>
    <li>If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an
      insurance claim</li>
    <li>For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin</li>
    <li>If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse</li>
    <li>If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy
      of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement
      or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province</li>
    <li>If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the
      production of records</li>
    <li>If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the
      collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced</li>
    <li>If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes</li>
    <li>If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="4-when-and-with-whom-we-share-your-personal-information">4. WHEN AND WITH WHOM WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL
    INFORMATION</h2>

    third-party vendors, service providers, contractors, or agents (&quot;third parties&quot;) who perform services for
    us or on our behalf and require access to such information to do that work. We have contracts in place with our
    third parties, which are designed to help safeguard your personal information. This means that they cannot do
    anything with your personal information unless we have instructed them to do so. They will also not share your
    personal information with any organization apart from us. They also commit to protect the data they hold on our
    behalf and to retain it for the period we instruct. The categories of third parties we may share personal
    information with are as follows:</p>

  <p>Our Website or Services may link to third-party websites, online services, or mobile applications and/or contain
    advertisements from third parties that are not affiliated with us and which may link to other websites, services, or
    applications. Accordingly, we do not make any guarantee regarding any such third parties, and we will not be liable
    for any loss or damage caused by the use of such third-party websites, services, or applications. The inclusion of a
    link towards a third-party website, service, or application does not imply an endorsement by us. We cannot guarantee
    the safety and privacy of data you provide to any third parties. Any data collected by third parties is not covered
    by this Privacy Policy. We are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of any
    third parties, including other websites, services, or applications that may be linked to or from the Services. You
    should review the policies of such third parties and contact them directly to respond to your questions.</p>
  <h2 id="6-cookies-and-other-tracking-technologies-we-use">6. COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES WE USE</h2>
  <p>We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to access or store information.
  </p>
  <p>Cookies are small text files or other storage technologies stored on your computer by your internet browser. These
    cookies process specific information about you, such as your browser version, location data, IP address, etc. For
    more information about cookies and disabling them, consult them at <a
      href="https://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/">https://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/</a>.</p>

    available.</p>
  <h3 id="third-party-cookies">Third-party Cookies</h3>
  <p>Our Online Game may use cookies from companies with whom we cooperate for the purpose of improving our Online Game,
    advertising or analyzing.</p>
  <h3 id="disabling-cookies">Disabling Cookies</h3>
  <p>You can decline the use of Cookies by changing the settings on your internet browser.</p>
  <p>In addition, you can use your internet browser to delete cookies that have already been stored in it.</p>

  <h2 id="7-how-long-we-keep-your-information">7. HOW LONG WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION</h2>
  <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy
    Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal
    requirements).</p>
  <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or
    anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been
    stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further
    processing until deletion is possible.</p>
  <h2 id="8-how-we-keep-your-information-safe">8. HOW WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE</h2>
  <p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect
    the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your
    information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be
    100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties
    will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although
    we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our
    Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.</p>

    collected Personal Data from anyone under the age of 13 without verification of parental consent, We take steps to
    remove that information from Our servers. If We need to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing Your
    information and Your country requires consent from a parent, We may require Your parent&#39;s consent before We
    collect and use that information.</p>

  <h2 id="11-controls-for-do-not-track-features">11. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
  <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track
    (&quot;DNT&quot;) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your
    online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and
    implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any
    other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online
    tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version
    of this Privacy Policy.</p>
  <h2 id="12-california-residents-specific-privacy-rights">12. CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS: SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS</h2>
